# Genrify
Automatically sorts music files into folders based on their genre
Version 1.1
       
All music will be sorted using metadata on given category,

Note that if the name has a '/' in it, eg. Pop/Rock, the song will be added to both the Pop and Rock folder. 
if undefined will be placed in an 'undefined' category folder.  

Uses the Apache Tika library to help extract metadata and swing for the GUI
