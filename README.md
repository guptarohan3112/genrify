# Genrify
Automatically sorts music files into folders based on their genre__
Version 0.00

Usage: Input directory (Currently cmd line argument) with unsorted music as the first arg,
       as well as folder where to place the sorted folders as second arg. All music will be
       sorted using metadata, if undefined will be placed in an 'undefined' genre folder.__
       TODO : add other folder sorting filters and a gui to make more friendly
